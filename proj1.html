    <h1>Project 1</h1>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
    The goal of the first project is to familiarize you with sockets
    programming in C. You will create a client that sends a string
    to a server, and a server that responds with a value. After you get
    this basic operation working, you will enhance the client and server so 
    that two message types are supported. 
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    <b>Due:</b> Tuesday, February 4th, 11:55am EST<br>
    <b>Points:</b> 100 
    </p>

    <p>
    You are to develop a networked application that takes a text string specifying
    the name of a bank account on the client side, transmits that string to the server, 
    and then receives a return value from the server that is the account balance (in integer
    dollars) for the named account. You should support four named accounts: mySavings, myChecking,
    myRetirement and myCollege. You should pre-configure your server with balances for each. 
    Make them all different (and positive integers!).
    Both client and server must use TCP to exchange messages. The client must take 
    the account name as a command line argument as well as the server IP address and port 
    number. Be sure to include error checking in case any of these arguments are missing or
    incorrectly formatted. 
    </p>

    <p> 
    After getting this working, you are to
    develop a more complex version that supports two message types, one
    called BAL used as in the first part to ask the server for the balance on
    a named account, and the other called COUNT used to ask the server for the count 
    of the number of times the balance has been requested for a named account. This
    functionality might be used, for example, to detect an unusual level of activity
    on a particular account. Your client and server will need to be modified to allow
    two message types. Your client should take two command line arguments in addition to
    the server IP address and port number: one that specifies
    the type of request (BAL or COUNT) and the other that gives the named account. Your
    server will need to track the number of BAL requests to each account in order to 
    respond accurately to COUNT requests. 
    </p>

    <p>
    To get you started, I have provided you with a code framework. These
    files include <a href="client.c">client.c</a>,
    <a href="server.c">server.c</a> and a 
    <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a> to get things compiled. Note
    that this work <i>must</i> be done on a Linux/UNIX machine. 
    
    <p>
    The first part of the project (simple request/response) should not be difficult. 
    The second will be slightly more difficult. Do not wait until the last minute to
    work on it. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that students should use the "Shuttle" servers here at the College
    of Computing. More information can be found 
    <a href="https://support.cc.gatech.edu/facilities/general-access-servers">
    here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
    <p>
    Students are to turn in all their files as a single tarfile, submitted
    directly to T-Square. The tarfile should be your named as follows: 
    your_last_name-proj1.tar.gz. To make a tarfile, I would do the following
    on the command line: 
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>tar zcvf zegura-proj1.tar.gz client.c server.c Makefile 
	zegura-output.txt</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    As shown above, students must also turn in a file containing sample
    output from their program (last_name-output.txt). Specifically, students
    must enter a sequence of BAL requests to different accounts and with 
    at least two COUNT requests interspersed, and show the results returned
    by the server.  
    </p>

    <p>
    Remember that the Academic Integrity policies outlined both in the 
    Student Handbook, the course syllabus and the first lecture are in
    effect. This is an individual assignment. <font color=red> Students 
    detected cheating or collaborating will immediately be referred to the
    Office of Student Integrity.</font>
